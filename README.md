# SVM-for-heart-disease-classification
This repository contains the implementation of Support Vector Machine models to classify patient data and predict the likelihood of coronary heart disease. It explores hard-margin, soft-margin, and semi-supervised SVM approaches, evaluates their performance using various metrics, and identifies the most effective model for accurate prediction.
